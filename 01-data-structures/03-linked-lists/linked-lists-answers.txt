1. Spatial locality is where in actual geography (typically of a hard drive etc) item are located in relation to each other. How arrays are actually literally next to each other. 


2.  In my benchmark, the array went faster than the linked list for every action, but when i looked it up i found out that linked lists are faster for some other things. also, linked lists seem to hae some other benefits that are not speed related.

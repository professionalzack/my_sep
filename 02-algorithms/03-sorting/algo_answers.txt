The heap sort took the longest time by a long shot, and I imagine that is because it has to make an entire heap, inserting every single node one-by-one. That takes a long time. Bubble was the next slowest (although still much faster than heap), presumably due to how many times it has to iterate over the entire array. Next is merge, because although the divide-and-conquer technique helps, the final actual merging is a bit unweildy. Bucket sort was actually the quickest. it has the fewest full-array iterations, which i think helps considerably, and when the divide-and-conquer is over, the concatination is fairly seamless. insertsion sort also has a limited number of iterations, going over the original array only once.
